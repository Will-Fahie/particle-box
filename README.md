# particle-box
A fun particle simulator! Add as many particles as you want with different sizes. Toggle and control effects like gravity and circular motion, enable or disable collisions, control the flow of time, add various objects to collide with, and more! Test one of 9 pre-built simulations!

PyGame required!
